## Running locally for development

To run locally, you must first clone the repository. After that run the following commands in the root of the repository:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

You have to also make an `.env` file to configure your environment. [See guide to setup env](#how-to-get-env-variables).

## How to get env variables

### The Movie Database (TMDB) API Read Access Token

To get your `TMDB_KEY`:

- Go to [TMDB's website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- Sign up for an account if you don’t have one already.
- Once logged in, navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
- In the settings menu, select API (or go directly to TMDB API Settings).
- Click Create to generate a new API key. You might need to fill out a form describing your use case.
- Once approved, copy your `API Read Access Token` into the `TMDB_KEY` variable.

### Turso Database URL and Auth Token

To get your `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN` and `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`:

- Visit [Turso](https://turso.tech/) and create an account if you don’t have one.
- After logging in, create a new database by following the instructions in the dashboard.
- Once the database is created, click on the 3 dots next to the database name and select "Create Token" and follow the instructions to create a new token.
- After token created, you will see the token and database variables.

- Copy the values and paste them into the `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN` and `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL` variables
  Example .env file

Here’s how your .env file should look:

```bash
ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL="libsql://*****************"
ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN="**************************"
```

### Better Auth

- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the URL of your website.
- `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` is the URL of your website.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is a secret key that you can generate using [this tool](https://generate-random.org/encryption-key-generator).

Here’s how your .env file should look:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://wovie.vercel.app"
BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS="https://wovie.vercel.app"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```
